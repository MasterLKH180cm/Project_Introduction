## 6 minutes walking test image system
### Advisor
Prof. Fei-Pei Lai, principal investigator of Medical Informatics Laboratory  
Dr. Jung-Yien Chien, pulmonologist at National Taiwan University Hospital

### Project introduction
6 minutes walking test is an important clinical test in assessing aerobic capacity and endurance. A patient is asked to walk back and forth through  a 30 meters hallway in 6 minutes, and a professional caregiver needs to stay next to the patient during the test. This system aims to make patients have the ability to conduct the test outside the hospital without accompanied by a caregiver.
### Contribution
1. Use Jetson Nano and camera to fetch the real-time image of the test.
2. Use Yolo v4 to detect the patients' joints.
3. Calculate the distance and velocity the patient has walked during the test.

### Lateralization Of Womenâ€™S Brain Change With Age
#### Advisor 
Prof. Yu-Te Wu, principal investigator of Medical Image and Signal Analysis Laboratory
#### Project introduction
The lateralization of brain function refers to some neural functions, or cognitive processes tend to be more dominant in one hemisphere than the other. The project is to find out the relation between age and the change of lateralization pattern.
#### Contribution
1. Use 100 females' T1 images with cortical surface extraction and curvature_based alignment.

    - surface area
    - volume  

3. Calculate the lateralization index as (R-L)/(R+L).  
4. Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients for their lateralization index and ages.
